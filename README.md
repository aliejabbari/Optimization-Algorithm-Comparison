## **Optimization Algorithm Comparison**

Welcome to the Optimization Algorithm Comparison! This notebook aims to compare the performance of two popular optimization algorithms, Gradient Descent and Adam, in finding the global minimum of a complex cost function. We'll delve into the details of each algorithm, visualize their paths to the minimum, and analyze their convergence behaviors.

**Notebook Overview:**

1. **Complex Cost Function:** We start by defining a complex cost function with multiple local minima and maxima. Understanding the landscape of this function is crucial to grasp the challenges posed in optimization.

2. **Gradient Descent:** We implement the Gradient Descent algorithm, a basic optimization technique, and observe its path to the global minimum. We experiment with different learning rates to study their impact on convergence.

3. **Adam Optimization:** Next, we explore the Adam optimization algorithm, a popular variant of the stochastic gradient descent method. We compare Adam's performance with Gradient Descent and analyze the influence of hyperparameters like learning rate and momentum.

4. **Visualizing Paths:** To gain deeper insights, we visualize the paths taken by both algorithms on the 3D surface of the complex cost function. These plots offer an intuitive understanding of how each optimization method navigates the function's landscape.

5. **Comparison and Conclusion:** We present a comprehensive comparison of Gradient Descent and Adam. By analyzing convergence rates, computational efficiency, and the ability to escape local minima, we draw meaningful conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

**Conclusion:**

The Optimization Algorithm Comparison notebook offers a valuable learning experience in understanding optimization techniques.
